**Hi there! 👋 I'm André Dietrich** &#x20;
**Researcher @ TU Bergakademie Freiberg**

Driven by curiosity and committed to open knowledge, I explore the cutting edge of web development, decentralized architectures, and the future of learning technologies. From crafting interactive educational experiences to advancing peer-to-peer systems, my passion lies at the intersection of code, community, and collaboration.

## 🔭 Current Projects

* **LiaScript**
  An extensible, Markdown-powered framework that transforms static content into interactive slides, quizzes, simulations, and live coding examples—all running in your browser with no installation or compilation required. Supports collaborative classrooms via Nostr, WebTorrent, GunDB, and others.

* **edrys‑Lite**
  A browser-based, peer-to-peer remote lab platform that enables educators and learners to build, share, and run experiments on real hardware using web standards (WebRTC, CRDTs). Fully decentralized and OER‑friendly, with modular configurations that can be extended by the community.

## ❤️ Favourite Languages

* **Elm**: Delightfully safe, purely functional UIs with zero runtime exceptions.
* **TypeScript**: Scalable, strongly-typed JavaScript for large codebases.
* **SelectScript**: A dynamic multi-paradigm language (imperative, procedural, functional, object-oriented, declarative, relational) with a Clojure-based compiler and REPL for the SandhillSkipperVM. Runs on 8‑bit microcontrollers or as a Python‑based query language for simulations.

## 🌐 Open Source & OER Advocate

I believe in community-driven innovation: open source software and open educational resources make learning accessible and collaborative. All my projects are released under permissive licenses, and I contribute regularly to OER initiatives.
